# Wonderland Engine Components

Wonderland Engine's official component library.

Learn more about Wonderland Engine at [https://wonderlandengine.com](https://wonderlandengine.com).

# Versioning

As npm packages only support three digits of [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning),
the package version **does not match the editor version**.
Only the first two digits match the editor, the rest should be seen as a "package version".

# Usage

Install the components to your project's package as follows:
```
npm i --save @wonderlandengine/components
```

Wonderland Editor will automatically detect all components in the package add auto-import
those that you use in the scene.
